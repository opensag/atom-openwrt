     * dwarf_abbrev.c, dwarf_frame.c, dwarf_frame3.c,dwarf_line.c,
       pro_reloc_stream.c, pro_section.c: 
       Rename local variables to avoid
       compiler warnings about local variables reusing
       outer scope (including global) names.
     * dwarf_elf_access.c: Add AARCH64 support.
     * dwarf_reloc_arm.h: Add AARCH64 support.
     * libdwarf2.1.mm: dwarf_highpc() documentation admits
       it does not work properly for DWARF4 in all cases.
       dwarf_highpc() needs to be fixed.
     * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated
2013-06-08  David Anderson
     * libdwarf2.1.mm: Improved the documentation of
       dwarf_highpc() function to suggest how to interpret
       the value (pc or offset).
     * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated.
2013-03-08  David Anderson
     * dwarf_elf_access.c: Now we handle K10M and L10M
       as having relocations named as in x86, x86_64.
2013-02-07  David Anderson
     * dwarf_elf_access.c: FreeBSD did not have R_PPC64_ADDR32
       as a relocation name, so changed one name to be the name
       usable in Ubuntu and FreeBSD, R_PPC_ADDR32.
2013-02-01  David Anderson
     * libdwarf2.1.mm: Improved the documentation of the
       badly-named functions dwarf_whatform() and 
       dwarf_whatform_direct().
     * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated.
     * libdwarf.h.in: The arguments to dwarf_whatform[_direct]()
       are renamed for clarity. They are commented out, so
       this is just improving documentation.
2013-01-20  David Anderson
     * libdwarf.h: Removed.
     * libdwarf.h.in: Added. Identical content to standard libdwarf. 
     * configure.in: Generates libdwarf.h.
       Notices if struct _Elf in libelf.h and generates libdwarf.h
       appropriately.
     * configure: Regenerated
     * README now mentions the libdwarf.h generation at configure time.
2013-01-28  David Anderson
     * dwarf_frame.c: Fix a macro so it does not test unsigned
       numbers as being less than zero. Fixes a compiler warning.
     * malloc_check.c: Add void as the parameter list of a
       parameter-less function. Fixes a compiler warning.
2013-01-26  David Anderson
     * libdwarf.h: Remove the lc_number3 field to restore
       interface binary compatibility with earlier releases.
     * dwarf_loc.c, dwarf_loc.h: No longer uses the removed
       lc_number3 or lr_number3 fields. 
2013-01-25  David Anderson
     * dwarf_alloc.c: Changed some local names to avoid
       compiler warnings about redefining names in inner contexts.
     * dwarf_frame2.c: Changed some local names to avoid
       compiler warnings about redefining names in inner contexts.
       Added const to some declarations to avoid warnings
       about const being cast away.
     * dwarf_init_finish.c: Added const to some declarations 
       to avoid warnings about const being cast away.
       Changed some local names to avoid
       compiler warnings about redefining names in inner contexts.
     * dwarf_line.c, dwarf_print_lines.c: Added const to some declarations 
       to avoid warnings about const being cast away.
       Added static to function definition to reflect its use
       and to avoid warning about lack of a visible prototype.
     * gennames.c: Using C89/90 void to declare functions with
       no arguments to avoid compiler warnings about using old style
       declarations.
       Changed some local names to avoid
       compiler warnings about redefining names in inner contexts.
       Added const to some declarations to avoid warnings
       about const being cast away.
     * pro_incl.h: WRITE_UNALIGNED macros now cast with const
        to avoid warnings about const being cast away.
     * pro_macinfo.c,pro_section.c,pro_section.h:  Added const 
       to some declarations to avoid warnings about const being cast away.
2013-01-25  David Anderson
     * common.c: Add 'const' on string declarations to avoid
       compiler warnings.
     * dwarf_loc.h: Add the new field lc_number3 to handle
       DW_OP_GNU_const_type properly.
     * dwarf_loc.c: Handle  DW_OP_GNU_const_type properly.
     * libdwarf.h: Add lr_number3 so we can handle DW_OP_GNU_const_type 
       properly. This destroys binary compatibility. Not a good idea.
       See Jan 26, above.
2013-01-25  David Anderson
     * dwarf_loc.c: Use cc_length_size, not cc_length to get
       the offset size. Nasty bug.
     * dwarf_opaque.h: Change commentary to clarify the cc_length
       field content to hopefully avoid making that mistake again.
2013-01-15  David Anderson
     * dwarf.h: defines for some added DW_OP_GNU operators
     * dwarf_loc.c: Added support for some DW_OP_GNU operators.
     * config.h.in, configure.in: Define and set HAVE_STRUCT_UNDERSCORE_ELF
       as FreeBSD names struct _Elf instead of struct Elf.
     * configure: Regenerated.
     * dwarf_alloc.c: Initialize a local var at declaration, add const
       to array of strings type declaration.
     * dwarf_alloc.h: Change ah_structs_per_chunk to Dwarf_Sword
       to eliminate a compiler warning. 
     * dwarf_arange.c: Change a couple Dwarf_Unsigned to Dwarf_Signed
       to eliminate a compiler warning.
     * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Change local to Dwarf_Unsigned to eliminate
       signed compare warning (and actually signed was wrong anyway!).
     * dwarf_error.c: Fix comparison to eliminate signed/unsigned
       compare warning.
     * dwarf_form.c: Index variable changed to unsigned to
       eliminate signed/unsigned comparison warning.
     * dwarf_frame.c: Local variables changed to unsigned to
       eliminate signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
     * dwarf_frame3.c: Local variables changed to unsigned to
       eliminate signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
     * dwarf_init_finish.c: Local variable changed to unsigned to
       eliminate signed/unsigned comparison warning.
     * dwarf_leb.c: Local variable changed to unsigned to
       eliminate signed/unsigned comparison warning.
     * dwarf_line.c: Changed index variable to unsigned to
       eliminate signed/unsigned comparison warning.
     * dwarf_loc.c: Delete two unused local variables.
     * dwarf_loc.c: Delete two unused local variables.
     * dwarf_macro.c: Fixed comparisons
       eliminate signed/unsigned comparison warning.
     * dwarf_opaque.h: Changed cc_abbrev_offset and de_fde_count
       to unsigned (which they should have been all along) to
       eliminate signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
     * dwarf_print_lines.c: Local variable changed to unsigned to
       eliminate signed/unsigned comparison warning.
     * dwarf_util.c: Add include of pro_encode_nm.h to avoid
       a compiler warning. Changed index variable to unsigned to
       eliminate signed/unsigned comparison warning.
     * libdwarf.h: Add ability to handle struct _Elf.
     * pro_alloc.c: Move an include of malloc.h as it is
       not needed if stdlib.h is present.
     * pro_forms.c: Changed index variable to unsigned to
       eliminate signed/unsigned comparison warning.
     * pro_util.h: Add specific allowance for FreeBSD include and
